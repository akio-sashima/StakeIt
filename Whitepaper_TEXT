THE IDEA

If the purpose of investing in cryptocurrencies is to earn profit, 
why should you or any of us beat around the bush?

In the early days of crypto, 
there were many altcoins created with a single purpose in mind.

“Profit”

These altcoins had many innovative ideas and implementations but ultimately failed to last.

The reason is simple.

“Lack of a Long-term Plan”

The recent ICO craze and the increased popularity of cryptocurrency and the blockchain industry has brought thousands of new projects on board with thousands of new coins and tokens created.

We are in the wild west as they call it.

Now let’s get back to the basics.

Welcome to the world of STAKE.

 

Created with one purpose in mind.
Long-term Profit
StakeIt Token
Name: StakeIt
Symbol: STAKE
Decimals: 8
Type: ERC20 Token
Blockchain: Ethereum
Total Supply: 100,000,000 STAKE

There will only ever be 100 million STAKE tokens (initially).

Tokens will be bought back and destroyed continuously.

Staking takes place off-chain on our dashboard (website) as points on accounts.

DISTRIBUTION
 
Stake reserve will be stored on 5 different addresses for users to easily identify when the next tier will be activated (see staking plans below) as well as for security reasons.

Bounty address will be revealed to the public with all transactions transparently noted on a public ledger on the website. 

Note that majority of the bounty tokens will be distributed once all the staking plans have ended and there are no more tokens to be distributed as ‘stake rewards’.

Marketing & development costs will be covered by the funds we have accumulated through our token sale.

STAKING PLANS

Staking plans are divided into 5 tiers.

Stake Reserves (75 million) are kept in 5 different addresses (15 million each).

Tiers are activated accordingly whenever 15 million STAKE has been distributed from the Stake Reserve addresses. 

For example, when all 15 million STAKE from the tier 1 address has been spent/distributed, tier 2 will be activated and so on.

TIERS & FEES
Tier 1: First 15 million from Stake Reserves 
0.035% daily (Approximately 12.775% per year)
Minimum amount required for staking: 1,000 STAKE
Fee: $2 equivalent in ETH

Tier 2: Second 15 million from Stake Reserves
0.05% daily (Approximately 18.25% per year)
Minimum amount required for staking: 2,000 STAKE
Fee: $5 equivalent in ETH

Tier 3: Third 15 million from Stake Reserves (BEST STAKE RATE)
0.075% daily (Approximately 27.375% per year)
Minimum amount required for staking: 5,000 STAKE
Fee: $10 equivalent in ETH

Tier 4: Fourth 15 million from Stake Reserves
0.05% daily (Approximately 18.25% per year)
Minimum amount required for staking: 8,000 STAKE
Fee: $15 equivalent in ETH

Tier 5: Final 15 million from Stake Reserves
0.035% daily (Approximately 12.775% per year)
Minimum amount required for staking: 10,000 STAKE
Fee: $20 equivalent in ETH

HOW IT WORKS

Firstly, we would like to remind you that staking is a centralized option that we provide.

You are free to do whatever you want with STAKE tokens.

Feel free to just ‘hold’ them under your ETH addresses.

For users to ‘stake’ tokens, they will be required to register on our website.

Our website will have a ‘staking product’ in which you will have to purchase it (for payment of staking fees).

When a user checks out of the shop, the user will be instructed to send tokens to a specified address and give us details of the transaction (TXID & amounts sent).

Once manually checked, the user will be credited with STAKE on the website (off-chain) and it will stake daily automatically on our website, under your account.

All tokens deposited to the specified address are destroyed (the address is publicly available, see Token Addresses – Revenues address - below).

This means that when a user ‘withdraws’ his/her tokens from our website, the tokens are solely distributed from the ‘Token Reserve’ addresses.

Users can choose to withdraw by requesting a withdrawal at any time they want. 

They will need to provide an ETH address to receive the tokens (24 hours processing time applies as we will check all withdrawals manually, for security reasons).

These tokens are sent from our STAKE RESERVE addresses which hold 
75 million STAKE in total.

Fees
Note that you will have to pay small fees in ETH whenever you deposit and stake your tokens (by purchasing the product on our website).

These fees are used to buy back our tokens on exchanges & the tokens will be destroyed permanently to ensure constant growth of demands.

All fees accumulated can be viewed on our ‘Revenues’ address (see addresses below).

This Revenues address is the same address which receives all tokens sent by users for staking. 

All tokens sent to this address are immediately destroyed.

There is also a minimum amount of STAKE required for each staking plans/tiers. 

This is to ensure that your tokens stake properly according to 8 decimals as well as to ensure a healthy balance between supply X demand.

It is inevitable that we will one day, run out of StakeIt tokens to distribute as staking rewards.

Note that before we run out of Stake Tokens to distribute (at the end of Tier 5), we will stop all existing staking plans on our website. 

This will happen when the Tier 5 Stake Reserves address has less than
5 million STAKE in total.

As we stop all staking plans on our website, we will distribute all existing pending payments (withdrawal) with all leftover tokens (if any) from Tier 5 Stake Reserves address sent to our Bounty address.

From this point on, the token completely switches into a ‘bounty & giveaway’ token.

All bounty & giveaway campaigns will be held on our 1-page AD platform (more details below). 

During this period, our 1-page AD platform will play a vital part in generating revenues for us.

These revenues are also used to buy back tokens on the exchanges and destroyed. 

This period continues until we have completely run out of Bounty tokens (5 million) + leftover tokens from the Tier 5 Stake Reserves address.

When this happens, we will deem our staking and bounty plans to be officially over and the token’s future will be in the hands of the community.

We believe that by this period, the token will already have a strong community with many use cases readily offered, created, and explored by the community members.

TOKEN BUY & DESTROY PLANS

Whenever a user registers and deposits to stake his/her StakeIt tokens, they will be required to pay small fees in ETH (by purchasing a product on our website).

These fees will be wholly used to buy back tokens on exchanges and they will be permanently destroyed.

Along with this plan, StakeIt website will feature a 1-page AD platform.

This AD platform will consist of 100 different AD slots.

Advertisers will be required to pay in StakeIt tokens.

STAKE Bounty & Giveaway campaigns will be held on this page to ensure constant in-flow of traffic and to attract more advertisers.

All StakeIt tokens received through this platform will be destroyed. 

Revenues (ETH – Staking fees) (STAKE – Advertisement fees, Amounts sent by users for staking) are all accumulated under a single address. 

Revenues address: 0x15FeA068839632bf9E580b73283778de9716eE09

Users will be able to view how all STAKE received are destroyed as well as track all ETH received as they are used to buy back & destroy tokens.

ROADMAP
 

As soon as the token sale ends, we will be listing the token on exchanges (mercatox, hitbtc, etherdelta, and coinexchange).

If you have any suggestions for exchanges, please feel free to leave a comment on our bitcointalk ANN thread.

Please note that this roadmap is a briefly structured plan for display purposes only.

Concise roadmap with detailed action plans will be revealed in December.

TEAM

 

We are a small team of Cryptocurrency enthusiasts living all around the world.

By now, you should have realized that we are in fact, not keeping any of the tokens for ourselves. 

The only funds we will have as development fees will be the funds collected through our token sale.

Although this token is not to be treated as a security, the nature of it has the potentials to be treated as one.

As such, to avoid legal and tax issues, we will not be revealing ourselves. 

We know that we are going to get stones thrown at us for this but this won't stop us from further developing this project. 

We believe that with time, we will be able to prove our legitimacy.
